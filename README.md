# DSA Problems solved as Patterns

## Pattern 1 - Two Pointers
### Problem 1 - Valid Palindrome
```
        Given a string, s, return TRUE if it is a palindrome; otherwise, return FALSE.
         A phrase is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward after
        converting all uppercase letters to lowercase and removing any characters that are not letters 
        or numbers. Only alphanumeric characters (letters and digits) are taken into account.
